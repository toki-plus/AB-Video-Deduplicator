> This open-source version is an early release intended for technical research and educational purposes only. Do not use it for any illegal activities. Due to platform algorithm updates, its deduplication effectiveness may not meet current standards.

**AB Video Deduplicator is an open-source desktop application for video creators, designed to fundamentally alter a video's data fingerprint using an innovative "high-frame-rate frame sampling and blending" technique. It aims to bypass originality checks and deduplication mechanisms on major short-video platforms like TikTok.**

## üí° How It Works

Traditional deduplication methods (filters, scaling, mirroring) are becoming less effective. This tool employs a more fundamental "frame blending" strategy:

1.  **Input Two Videos**:
    *   **Video A (Content Video)**: The main video you want to publish.
    *   **Video B (Material Video)**: An original, unrelated video.

2.  **Generate High-Frame-Rate Stream**: The tool creates a high-frame-rate (e.g., 60/120/240 fps) video stream.

3.  **Intelligent Frame Insertion**: Using a specific algorithm, frames from **Video A** are inserted into key positions of the new stream, while frames from **Video B** are used to fill the gaps between them.

4.  **Final Result**: Due to platform compression, viewers on mobile devices still see a smooth playback of **Video A**. However, at the data level, the newly generated video contains a substantial number of frames from **Video B**, making its MD5 hash and data fingerprint completely different from the original, thus achieving deep deduplication.

| Deduplication Level | Target FPS | Approx. A:B Frame Ratio |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **50%** | 60 | 1 : 1 |
| **75%** | 120 | 1 : 3 |
| **87.5%**| 240 | 1 : 7 |

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   **Intuitive GUI**: Built with PyQt5 for simple, command-line-free operation.
-   **Three Deduplication Levels**: Offers 50% (60fps), 75% (120fps), and 87.5% (240fps) modes.
-   **üöÄ NVIDIA GPU Acceleration**: Supports NVENC hardware encoding for significantly faster processing.
-   **Auto Resolution Matching**: Automatically resizes Video B to match Video A's resolution.
-   **Audio Preservation**: The original audio track from Video A is fully retained.
-   **Real-time Progress & Logging**: Clearly displays processing progress and detailed logs.
-   **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux (with correct dependencies installed).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### System Requirements

1.  **Python**: Version 3.8 or newer.
2.  **FFmpeg**: **Must** be installed and its executable path added to the system's PATH environment variable.
    -   Windows: Download from [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
    -   macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
    -   Linux: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/toki-plus/AB-Video-Deduplicator.git
    cd AB-Video-Deduplicator
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Generate Qt Resource File:**
    The application's icon resources need to be compiled manually. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    pyrcc5 src/resources.qrc -o src/resources.py
    ```
5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## üìñ Usage Guide

1.  Click "Select Video A" to choose your **content video**.
2.  Click "Select Video B" to choose your **material video**.
3.  Select a mode from the "Deduplication Level" dropdown (start with 60fps for testing).
4.  Check "Enable GPU Acceleration" if you have a supported NVIDIA GPU.
5.  Click "Start Processing" and wait for the progress bar to complete.
6.  The processed video will be saved in the `output` folder.
